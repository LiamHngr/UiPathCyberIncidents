Update: 11.17.2019 | Andy Menon

This is the latest version of the Configuration database to be downloaded as a 
separate zip file for use with the Advanced Enterprise RPA Process flow template
available here: 

https://go.uipath.com/component/advanced-enterprise-rpa-process-template

Please read companion documentation (v3.0) that accompanies the template on how to: 
1. Unlock the database
2. Adding configuration settings to new projects
3. Deleting configuration settings for an existing project

For ease of use across a wider audience, the ConfigDB database is being 
published as an .mdb file instead of the most recent .accdb file.
